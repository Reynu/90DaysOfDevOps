# Day 39 – What is CI/CD?

## Task 1: The Problem

### What can go wrong with 5 devs manually deploying?

* Two developers push conflicting code at the same time — one overwrites the other's changes (merge conflicts)

* A dev deploys untested code directly to production, breaking the live app

* No one knows who deployed what or when — debugging becomes a blame game

* One dev's environment has a different Python/Node version — works locally, crashes in prod

* No rollback plan — if the deploy breaks things, the team scrambles manually to fix it

### No rollback plan — if the deploy breaks things, the team scrambles manually to fix it

This happens when a developer's local environment differs from the server: different OS, different dependency versions, different env variables, different config files. CI/CD solves this by running code in a clean, controlled, identical environment every time — no "my machine" bias.

### How many times can a team safely deploy manually?

Realistically: 1–2 times a day, if they're disciplined. With CI/CD and automation: teams like Netflix and Amazon deploy hundreds of times per day. Manual deploys don't scale — CI/CD does.


## Task 2: CI vs CD vs CD

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Developers merge code to a shared branch frequently (multiple times a day). Every merge automatically triggers tests and builds. It catches bugs early — before they pile up into a broken mess.

Real-world example: A developer opens a Pull Request on GitHub. GitHub Actions immediately runs unit tests. If tests fail, the PR is blocked from merging.

### Continuous Delivery (CD)

Everything CI does, plus: the code is automatically prepared and ready to deploy to production at any time — but a human still clicks the deploy button. "Delivery" means the software is always in a deployable state.

Real-world example: After tests pass, the pipeline builds a Docker image and pushes it to a staging environment. The team reviews it, then manually triggers the production deploy.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

Goes one step further than Delivery — no human approval needed. Every change that passes all tests is automatically deployed straight to production. Used by teams with high test confidence and mature pipelines.

Real-world example: A dev merges to main on Friday afternoon. Within 10 minutes, the change is live on production with zero manual steps. Teams like Etsy and Flickr use this model.

## Task 3: Pipeline Anatomy

Term	What it does
Trigger	The event that starts the pipeline — e.g. a git push, a PR, or a scheduled cron job
Stage	A logical phase of the pipeline — e.g. build, test, deploy. Stages run in order
Job	A unit of work inside a stage — e.g. "run unit tests" or "build Docker image"
Step	A single command or action inside a job — e.g. run: pytest tests/
Runner	The machine (VM or container) that actually executes the job — GitHub-hosted or self-hosted
Artifact	Output produced by a job that can be passed to the next stage — e.g. a compiled binary, Docker image, coverage report
